		<description>
			<p>The Vandals of the North are tribes of winter-worn vagabonds who claim the lands of Frossinheim. Those who live in the mainland refer to them as "savages," including those who hail from Vinterstadt and Raevnholdt, due to their histories.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are a Vandal tribe member. Your people have always tried to hold on to the old ways. Tradition and conquest have kept the Vandals of the North strong, taking advantage of the disarray in the south. For the last few generations however, the Shoravi empire have made peace within the central continent, putting conquest at a standstill.</p>
			<p class="indent">You might have grown up in one of the tribes that settled in Vinterstadt or Raevnholdt, and find yourself in a conflict between the old ways of the Vandals, and the soft ways of civilization. Or you might come from a segment of the Vandals that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A hunting trap, a set of tattoos marking your loyalty to the Vandals, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Vandal tribe.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Vandal ancestral mounds- great hills where the heroes of the tribes are interred- are sacred to you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Vandal philosophy or culture. Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn’t contradict or compromise what being a Vandal stands for.</p>

			<p>You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forge there.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often including members of druidic circles, or tribes of nomadic goliaths.</p>
